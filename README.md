- **Suggested Help Topics**:

  - Selecting the suggestion **“How do I get a refund?”** dynamically loads related resources and auto-generates supporting text.

- **Hover Interaction**:

  - Hovering over numbered indicators (**1** and **2**) displays contextual information related to the refund process.

- **Compressor Interaction**:

  - Clicking **“Add to Compressor”** sends the selected content to the **Chat Area** for further handling.

- **AI Integration**:
